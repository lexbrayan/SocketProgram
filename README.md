HOW TO RUN 

1)Code was written in python and will require a. python 3 interpreter to run

2)Open Terminal or command line, cd into the directory and run the command “python (filename)” i.e. python TCPwebservery.py

3)After running that command, a message will appear on screen

4)Once message appears on screen, go to web browser (Chrome is preferred) and input “localhost:1991/index.html” or “localhost:1991/main.html”. 

Note: Index.htmlis just a text file while main.htmlhas some images in it
